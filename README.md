# Card Vault

## Setup Instructions
Before you begin, ensure that you have **Docker** installed on your system.

First we need to build, pull and start the containers by running:
```sh
make up
```

After this you can open the docs locally in your browser by running:
```sh
make open service=docs
```

Or you can go to the latest **main** branch docs on [**github pages**](https://tombosmans.github.io/card-vault/#/)
